# Content of the repository
We are providing two python snippets:
* `build_and_upload.py` to build a dataset that contain videos and metadata and push it to Hugging Face (note that Video compatibility is a new feature, there might be additional ways to push Video compatible datasets in the future).
* `read_dataset.py` to consume the metadata and videos from the dataset

For more details, check HF Datasets Video Load documentation https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/main/en/video_load
